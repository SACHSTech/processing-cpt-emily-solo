# THE FLOOR IS LAVA

## Backstory    
A white ball, by the name of Fred, was exploring the Alariah volcanoes when a rock fell loose and he went tumbling down into a volcano. He is now trapped. His magic allowed him to keep afloat and protect himself from the lava that surrounds him, but his magic levels are slowly diminishing and he can no longer keep himself afloat for long periods of time. If he touches the ground, he will be burned by the lava and eventually die. He is calling on you to help.

## Game Objective 
Your mission is to keep Fred above ground and collect the red immunity circles to help Fred become immune to the lava. Your score is tracked by how many immunity circles you obtain. The higher your score, the more immune Fred will be. 

## How to Play
The game is simple. The racket follows the direction of your mouse so use your mouse to control the bouncing racket and protect the ball. Moving your mouse faster speeds up the ball and keeping your mouse still stabilizes the ball. However, the ball will never stop moving completely, it is constantly bouncing. Additionally, you can control the difficulty of the game yourself. If you find the game too easy, use the "s" key to decrease the size of the immunity circles. If you find the game too difficult, use the "w" key to increase the size of the immunity circles. If, for some reason, you need to pause the game, press p to pause and then click the mouse when you are ready to resume the game.

## Limitations
Sometimes, when the ball moves too fast, it falls through the racket. So carefully control the speed of the ball, as to not burn Fred and let him fall through. Also, be careful when you are adjusting the size of the immunity circles. You are unable to adjust the size of the circles and move your racket at the same time so coordinate the height of the ball with your racket so you can adjust the size of the immunity circles safely.
